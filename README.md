# Learning App for Kids

This Android Studio project is a learning app designed for children aged 7-10. The app features a login and sign-up screen powered by Firebase for user authentication. Once logged in, children are taken to the main menu, where they can access various educational games and features.

## Features

- **Login and Sign-up:** The app allows users to log in with their credentials or sign up for a new account using Firebase authentication.

- **Main Menu:** Upon successful login, children are taken to the main menu, which displays a top bar showing the current XP and username of the user.

  1. Learn Days
  2. Learn Months
  3. Learn Clocks
  4. Learn Seasons
  5. Learn Directions
  6. Learn Multiplication
  7. Learn Spelling
  8. Remember Digits
